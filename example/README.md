# Example Node Project

The main purpose of this repository is to show a working Node.js API Server + front-end project and workflow for writing Node code in TypeScript.

It is not a goal to be a comprehensive and definitive guide to making a TypeScript and Node project, but as a working reference maintained by the community. If you are interested in starting a new TypeScript project - check out the bootstrapping tools reference in [the TypeScript Website](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html)
